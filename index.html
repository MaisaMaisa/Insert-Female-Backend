            The most popular tools for building a website require zero to minimal coding knowledge. Dragged and dropped content in the colorful back-ends is published on the website's front-end in no time. All you have to do is click Publish. This web design automation puts us far from questioning the software logic and the rules of the language these tools root from, let alone study the art of programming. The last 30 years of Cyberfeminism can teach us that vibrant cultures and certain political situations can be read through the interfaces that shaped today's internet. The most enlightening era of the 1990s was when the first online collectives were formed, hypertext and literature were merged, default binaries within the programming languages were questioned, and wild personal interfaces ("online graffiti art") were massively self-published. In the early 2000s, however, social media platforms pushed these examples to the bottom of the search results, further fading them out of our user imagination and memory. Proposals for alternative internet were no longer present in the daily user discussion. An average user became an average consumer of information, bits, and bodies. Today, the mainstream arithmetic logics behind the popular tools and technologies are being picked up by AI in rapid speed aka maintaining and making the mainstream way more accessible than it ever was. The cost of extreme user-friendliness is user unhappiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            JOAN presents <i>[ Insert Female Backend ]</i> — a collective exhibition in which other-than-arithmetic web logics, methods, and aesthetics for the internet are deployed as proposals for a new digital future. Molly Soda scatters more than two decades worth of neglected digital content in no particular order to question the rules of institutional archiving traceable in the digital. Maya Man develops a Javascript script that generates non-sensical inspirational quotes for women as a method for blurring the need for authenticity in the performance of online self. Chia Amisola performs the girl-saint to question the theologies integrated in the machines. At the intersection of art and design, Clara Pasteau builds a writing tool that enables a meditative writing experience in the context of a loud internet. To urgently address the need for solidarity with people of Palestine, Noam Youngrak Son develops three tools that turn the user into an activist. As a literary experiment, Theo Ellin Ballew re-launches Oral Pub — an online publication for interactive literature. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Detailed descriptions of the artworks included in the exhibition:</strong></p>

        <p>
            𝙢𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙮𝙨𝙨𝙩𝙪𝙛𝙛 (by Molly Soda) pulls from over two decades worth of content accumulated by the artist Molly Soda. 2000 files were lovingly hand-selected from her assorted hard drives, computers, and online accounts and distributed amongst 20 folders—like dropping party favors into little bags. Each folder houses 100 files: .jpegs, .gifs, .pdfs, .movs, .pngs, .mp3s + more.<br><br>
            
            The.zip folder is physically embodied as a 𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙦𝙪𝙚 artist publication. Files are printed and assembled to populate a 3-ring binder. Videos are broken down into frames. Old webcam portraits become 4x6 keepsakes. Glitter graphics are printed on transparency paper. Spammy emails and Instagram ads litter the pages. Brought together in an artist's book, the files overlap and complicate each other, giving weight to often neglected digital content. Each binder comes with a signed certificate of authenticity.

            <strong>FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT: <a target="_blank" href="https://fakeittillyoumakeit.lol/">https://fakeittillyoumakeit.lol/</a></strong>(by Maya Man)
            borrows from the bubbly language and pastel aesthetics of text driven instagram graphics to scrutinize the promotion of wellness, self-care, and confidence on social media.<br><br>

            Online, these types of posts survive on likes, comments, and shares. What do I believe? becomes What do I want to appear to believe? Fake it till you make it! Maybe your dream life lives here: In a digital, fantasy world where the algorithm plays god and loving yourself feels like looking into the light of your screen.

            <strong>Computer Dream Angel Girl Saint: <a target="_blank" href="https://i-love-everything.com/world/cathedral/">https://i-love-everything.com/world/cathedral/</a></strong> (by Chia Amisola) -- a performance and a lecture tracing the artist's Catholic faith, Marian apparitions, feminine technologies, surveillance & delusion, Ishmael Bernal’s Himala, and the nature of faith, truth, and presence.<br><br>

            In an age where gods are indecipherable from machines, all bodies are heavens, technology is devotion, and delusions are divine. Weaving through the infrastructural role of technologies & relics, the feminine maternal roles of computers as containers, and the surveillant, performative nature of the girl-saint is a performance-lecture on gods, girls, gazing, and glitches.<br><br>

            The presentation previews Himala, a WIP durational desktop performance piece by Amisola, reenacting the mysteries of the rosary atop of the operating system & browser. An imagination and ritual of virginal software as a digital counterpoint to the Philippine Pasyón from the perspective of the girl-saint: the pure, sacred, transitory, and surveilled object of the divine.

            <strong>Tranquil Words Today: <a target="_blank" href="https://tranquil-words.today/">https://tranquil-words.today/</a></strong> (by Clara Pasteau) is a writing tool. It aims to be helpful when having a writing practice or wanting to experiment with automatic writing, surrounded by a loud internet.<br><br>

            <ul>How it works:
                <li>Start writing</li>
                <li>You won’t be able to see your text, it’s i……n…v…….i..…s….i.…b…l……e</li>
                <li>Let go…</li>
                <li>And keep writing</li>
                <li>Stay here</li>
                <li>Don’t change tab, or you will lose your text!</li>
                <li>Click on the clock if you want a 10’ timer</li>
                <li>You can change the background color depending on your mood</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Tech insights:
                <li>Built with Html, Css and Javascript only</li>
                <li>There is no database</li>
                <li>You can’t right click</li>
                <li>You can’t select your text</li>
                <li>You can’t delete your text</li>
                <li>If you change window, your text will vanish and you will have to start again</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Noam Youngrak Son</strong> is a communication designer practicing queer publishing. They explore revolutionary methods of disseminating deviant narratives. In their work, publishing concerns more than mere printed matter, since, in its etymology, the word "publishing" originally meant to populate communities and to breed interspecies relations. The term "queer" in this context is not used as a statement of identity but as that of methodology – small yet collective strategies of publishing that challenge the modern myth of a singular, heroic “Genius” designer.
